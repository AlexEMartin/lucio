  "How to portray the passage of time in our bodies? How do our bodies respond to memories, to spaces that were important to us? How can we return from the past to live a memory in the present?",
  "Faced of  these questions, we will experience what happens to us when we try to answer them, with the intention of taking the audience to another time. It is the impossible attempt to translate through flamenco, contemporary dance, theater, humor, acrobatics and live music, abstract concepts through a classic love story.",

  "This proposal seeks to spread dance in society through movement and the power of speech, performing  outdoors (street, courtyards, parks etc.) and reflecting on the experience in a theatre or a studi. To create the group of participants I organize an open call for people of any age, gender and identity regardless of their training or technical level.",

  "You should not be here. Neither should we. So we are going to inhabit together this moment that does not exist . We are just going to go from one thing to another. This is why this time in between has no demands. It is a time of being, existing without pretensions. All we have left is to rest in the unknown until… it arrives…what we…believe…think…feel has to …come.",

  "We researched on the idea of intimacy of being in one’s own space and what this «allows» in terms of the security and trust one feels when we are alone at home. We confront this with the idea of being filmed and 'seen' in this intimacy through the camera by a virtual audience. Adding to this the consequences of the effects of the pandemic and the trust in Maximiliano and, in turn, in each of us.",
  "As a director,  I was interested in the conflict that these concepts/ideas could provoke in Maximiliano’s body and emotional state and through contemporary dance, acrobatics and theatre, reflect it through the camera. Taking advantage, in turn, of Max’s great skill and virtuosity to express with his particular way of approaching the stage work. I was also interested in putting into play the difficulties that Max, who is usually expansive in his movements and acrobatics, dance in a small space and how his dance could unfold to its full potential in this context.",

How can two people who communicate through movement but from different backgrounds understand each other? How can the unknown affect us?",
  "This project reunites Mariana and Lucio, reaching 40 years old and with almost all of their lives dedicated to performing arts. Mariana is a flamenco dancer and Lucio a contemporary dancer, actor and acrobat. ‘MyL’ aims to question on stage, through dance, theatre and acrobatics, how it is to face what we consider different between a man and a woman whose only goal is to share a dance together.",

Reflection of identities and entities, search for movement embracing reality made dream. Passengers outlined by their shadows, untangling the nest and awakening the sleepy flight. Welcome… ",

In No Land its inhabitants define their identity at every step, inviting the viewer to complete with his gaze this journey.",

Through movement, through silence, we spy on the world where it expresses itself, letting out its feelings almost without controlling or wanting them.",
