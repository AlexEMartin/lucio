It is the impossible attempt to translate through flamenco, contemporary dance, theater, humor, acrobatics and live music, abstract concepts through a classic love story.",

We confront this with the idea of being filmed and 'seen' in this intimacy through the camera by a virtual audience. Adding to this the consequences of the effects of the pandemic and the trust in Maximiliano and, in turn, in each of us.",
  "As a director,  I was interested in the conflict that these concepts/ideas could provoke in Maximiliano’s body and emotional state and through contemporary dance, acrobatics and theatre, reflect it through the camera. Taking advantage, in turn, of Max’s great skill and virtuosity to express with his particular way of approaching the stage work. I was also interested in putting into play the difficulties that Max, who is usually expansive in his movements and acrobatics, dance in a small space and how his dance could unfold to its full potential in this context.",

Mariana is a flamenco dancer and Lucio a contemporary dancer, actor and acrobat. ‘MyL’ aims to question on stage, through dance, theatre and acrobatics, how it is to face what we consider different between a man and a woman whose only goal is to share a dance together.",
